My technical test with DSV company.

### task 1

I feel like I am missing some information to accomplish the task, some colons does have some duplicated data, the formula of the calculations ..

### task 2 (ETA. Acronym for “Estimated Time of Arrival.”)

1. I checked if they have a public API or documentation, but I could found relevent results
2. I tried to understand how their service is working (I opened the dev_console of my browser and tried few request)
3. I analysed the XML responses and the sheet to understand the structure and also the used words (Glossary)
4. I wrote a code to accomplish the task (I used `python3` `mongodb` `json`)

you could find the results in `/data_out/task2_ETAs.json`
